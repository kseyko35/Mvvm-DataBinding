AndroidTriviaNavigation - solution code
=======================================

This app is the solution code for Databinding, Room Database,Dagger2, MVVM, Navigation, Retrofit,
Hilt ,Coroutine and LiveData. With this app I tried to implement libraries which I sort above.
I hope it helps to all android developers.

Introduction
------------

This application includes just three three pages. With databinding you can bind all data everywhere
eaisly. Hilt is the newly and we can use it data injection. Folder architecture is very important
to be more understandable project, so you can use my folder architecture.Retrofit is type-safe REST
client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. When we
want to use retrofit library we also use converter-gson and okhttp3 library. Retrofit 2 by default
leverages OkHttp as the networking layer and is built on top of it. Retrofit automatically serialises
the JSON response using a POJO(Plain Old Java Object) which must be defined in advanced for the JSON
Structure. To serialise JSON we need a converter to convert it into Gson first.
